# Contributing to SoftSkill

Thank you for your interest in contributing. SoftSkill welcomes focused fixes, documentation improvements, tests, benchmark integrations, and soft-prefix training improvements.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xijia-tao/SoftSkill.git
cd SoftSkill
pip install -e ".[dev,softprefix]"
```

## How To Contribute

### Bug Reports

Open a GitHub issue with reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, and the config file you used. Remove API keys, local paths, and private data.

### Add A Benchmark

See the benchmark guide in `docs/guide/new-benchmark.md` and the scaffold at `skillopt/envs/_template/`.

### Improve Soft-Prefix Training

Keep changes covered by tests where practical. Avoid committing generated `outputs/`, `rollouts/`, local corpora, or model checkpoints.

### Improve Documentation

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
mkdocs serve
```
